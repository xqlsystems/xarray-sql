# Performance guide

How to get engine-limited speed out of registered xarray tables. Every
number below was measured on real cloud rasters (billions of pixels);
your mileage scales with network and core count, but the *ratios* are
structural.

## Make the source read in parallel

The single biggest lever is usually the reader, not the engine.

**GeoTIFF / rioxarray**: `rioxarray.open_rasterio` serializes GDAL tile
reads behind a lock by default, capping every scan at single-stream
speed no matter how many threads the adapter runs. On GDAL ≥ 3.11 use
the natively thread-safe LIBERTIFF driver; on older GDAL pass
`lock=False`:

```python
da = rioxarray.open_rasterio(
    url, chunks={"x": 2048, "y": 2048},
    driver="LIBERTIFF",   # GDAL >= 3.11; else keep lock=False only
    lock=False,
)
```

Measured on a 9-billion-pixel public cloud GeoTIFF, full-table
aggregation: default open **277 s** → `lock=False` **43 s** →
LIBERTIFF + `GDAL_NUM_THREADS=ALL_CPUS` **24 s**. With parallel reads,
remote (`/vsicurl/`) matched a local copy of the same file — the
network was never the bottleneck, the lock was.

Remote-read environment preset worth exporting for `/vsicurl/` sources:

```python
os.environ.update(
    GDAL_NUM_THREADS="ALL_CPUS",
    GDAL_DISABLE_READDIR_ON_OPEN="EMPTY_DIR",
    VSI_CACHE="TRUE",
)
```

**Zarr**: zarr-python 3's async store defaults to only 10 concurrent
requests; raise it before opening remote stores:

```python
zarr.config.set({"async.concurrency": 128})
```

On a moderately sized windowed query (~40 chunks of 4096² uint8 per
variable, GCS) this was a modest gain (4.2 s → 3.7 s); it matters more
as chunk counts grow and chunks shrink. The obstore-backed
`zarr.storage.ObjectStore` is worth benchmarking for high-concurrency
workloads, but was not faster at this scale in our tests — measure
before switching.

## Choose chunk sizes for the scan, not just the store

Every chunk costs one prefetch task, one pivot call, and one shadow
fragment. Aim for **1–8 M rows per chunk** (e.g. 2048²–4096² pixels for
2-D grids). The same 10 M-row scan ran 1.7× faster in 4 chunks than in
20. Axes with hundreds of thousands of chunks still prune in
milliseconds (the shadow index is bucketed), but scanning them pays
per-chunk overhead.

## Tune the adapter knobs

```python
xql.register(con, "t", ds, prefetch=12, batch_size=262_144)
```

- `prefetch`: chunk loads kept in flight ahead of the engine. The
  default (4) saturates local CPU work; raise to 8–12 for remote
  sources where latency dominates. Memory scales with
  `prefetch × pivoted chunk size`.
- `batch_size`: rows per Arrow batch. The default (64 Ki) is fine;
  values between 64 Ki and 1 Mi measured within a few percent of each
  other.

## Let pushdown do its job

Selective queries are fast *because of their predicates*: bounding-box
`WHERE` clauses on dimension columns prune to intersecting chunks, and
only the variables a query references are read. Corollaries:

- Prefer explicit column lists over `SELECT *` on wide datasets.
- Spatial functions (`ST_Within`, ...) are not pushed down — pair them
  with a bounding-box predicate that is: the box prunes, the geometry
  refines.
- A query with no `WHERE` on dimension columns is a full scan on any
  engine; that's physics, not a missing optimization.

## Threads and DuckDB connections

Registered Python objects are connection-local in DuckDB: `con.cursor()`
does not inherit them, and one connection's result slot is not
thread-safe. For multithreaded querying, give each thread its own
cursor and register the *same* dataset object on it:

```python
dataset = xql.arrow_dataset(ds)
def worker():
    cur = con.cursor()
    cur.register("t", dataset)   # cheap; shares the pruning index
    ...
```

The dataset object itself is safe to share across threads (verified
under concurrent query load).

## Stop re-scanning: materialize and pyramid

Repeated statistics should pay the scan once:

```python
xql.materialize(con, "cube",
    "SELECT FLOOR(y) AS lat, klass, COUNT(*) AS n FROM grid GROUP BY 1, 2",
    order_by=["lat", "klass"])

xql.pyramid(con, "grid_pyramid", "grid",
    aggs={"n": ("count", "*"),
          "hits": ("sum", "CASE WHEN klass >= 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END")},
    base_cell=0.05, levels=6)
```

`materialize` writes a native, sorted engine table (DuckDB compresses
the repetitive coordinate columns automatically and prunes range
predicates with zone maps). `pyramid` builds a multi-resolution
pre-aggregated cube in one source pass — coarse queries then read a few
thousand rows instead of billions of pixels. Both work on DuckDB and
DataFusion.

## The round-trip is optimized for grids

`xql.to_dataset` locates rows by arithmetic when an axis is uniformly
spaced (any regular raster or time step, ascending or descending) and
reshapes without any scatter when the result arrives grid-ordered.
Sparse or irregular results fall back to a positional scatter
automatically. If you want the raw sub-array of a registered Dataset
rather than a relational answer, plain `ds.sel(...)` is the direct
path — SQL adds value when the question is relational.

## The memory contract

Peak scan memory is bounded by `prefetch × pivoted-block-size` plus the
engine's own aggregation state — it does not grow with the amount of
data scanned. Measured on ARCO-ERA5 over anonymous GCS: a one-month
full-globe aggregation (772M rows) peaks at the same RSS as the
one-week scan (174M rows), ~0.75 GB with the defaults.

The block size is the source chunk size unless `coalesce_rows` is set,
in which case in-flight units are merged blocks: raising
`coalesce_rows` buys fewer round-trips at proportionally higher peak
memory (`prefetch=16, coalesce_rows=8_000_000` peaked at ~1.2 GB on the
same scan while cutting wall time ~1.5-2x). Size the two together.

`count(*)`-shaped queries never pay scan memory at all: unfiltered
counts are pure chunk arithmetic, and filtered counts scan only the
boundary chunks the filter cannot prove (see `count_rows`).
